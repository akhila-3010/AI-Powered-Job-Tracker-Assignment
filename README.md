### Data Flow

1. **Job Discovery:**
   - User applies filters → Frontend sends request to `/api/jobs`
   - Backend fetches from Adzuna API
   - If user has resume, jobs are scored via AI service
   - Results cached in Redis for 15 minutes

2. **Resume Processing:**
   - User uploads file → Sent to `/api/resume/upload`
   - PDF parsed or TXT read → Text extracted
   - Stored in Redis against user ID
   - Match score cache cleared to trigger re-scoring

3. **Application Tracking:**
   - User clicks "Apply" → Job opens in new tab
   - Tab focus event triggers popup
   - User confirms → POST to `/api/applications`
   - Application stored with timeline
   - Status updates send PATCH requests

4. **AI Chat:**
   - User sends message → POST to `/api/chat`
   - Message analyzed for intent (job search vs help)
   - Jobs filtered based on natural language
   - Response with jobs or help text returned

## 🤖 AI Matching Logic

### Scoring Algorithm

The AI matching system uses a weighted scoring algorithm:

\`\`\`javascript
const WEIGHTS = {
  skillMatch: 0.45,      // 45% - Matching skills
  experienceLevel: 0.30,  // 30% - Experience alignment
  titleRelevance: 0.25    // 25% - Job title match
};

Score = (skillScore × 0.45) + (experienceScore × 0.30) + (titleScore × 0.25)
\`\`\`

### How It Works

1. **Skill Extraction**
   - Parse resume and job description for 100+ tech skills
   - Categorize: Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps, Mobile, Data, Design
   - Case-insensitive matching with normalization

2. **Skill Matching (45%)**
   - Calculate overlap: `matchedSkills / totalJobSkills`
   - Example: Job needs 6 skills, you have 4 → 66% skill score

3. **Experience Level (30%)**
   - Detect level from keywords (junior, senior, lead, years)
   - Perfect match: 100%, Close match: 60-70%, Far match: 30%
   - Example: Senior role + Senior resume → 100%

4. **Title Relevance (25%)**
   - Extract keywords from job title
   - Check presence in resume
   - Example: "React Developer" + React experience → High score

5. **Final Score & Color Coding**
   - **Green (70-100%)**: Strong match, highly recommended
   - **Yellow (40-69%)**: Moderate match, worth considering
   - **Gray (0-39%)**: Weak match, may not align

### Match Explanation

For each job, we generate human-readable explanations:
- "Strong match: You have 5/6 required skills (React, Node.js, TypeScript, AWS, MongoDB)"
- "Experience level matches: Senior role aligns with your 5+ years"
- "Good fit: Your frontend focus matches this React Developer position"

### Performance Optimization

- **Batch Processing:** Score all jobs in parallel using `Promise.all()`
- **Caching:** Match scores cached in Redis, keyed by `userId:jobId`
- **Cache Invalidation:** Cleared when resume is updated
- **Fallback:** Rule-based scoring when OpenAI is unavailable (faster, no API costs)

### Efficiency Considerations

- **100 jobs:** ~2-3 seconds with rule-based scoring, ~15-20s with OpenAI
- **Recommendation:** Use rule-based for real-time, OpenAI for background processing
- **Future:** Job queue system for async AI scoring

## 🎯 Smart Popup Flow

### Design Decisions

The smart application popup solves a key problem: **tracking applications made on external sites.**

### User Journey

\`\`\`mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App
    participant ExternalSite as Job Site
    participant Backend
    
    User->>App: Clicks "Apply Now"
    App->>App: Store pending application
    App->>ExternalSite: Open in new tab
    Note over User,ExternalSite: User applies on external site
    User->>App: Returns to our tab
    App->>App: Detect tab focus
    App->>User: Show confirmation popup
    alt User confirms
        User->>Backend: POST /api/applications
        Backend->>Backend: Save with timestamp
    else User declines
        App->>App: Clear pending state
    end
\`\`\`

### Implementation Details

1. **State Management**
   - Store pending application in React state
   - Include: jobId, title, company, timestamp
   - Persist across tab switches (not across sessions)

2. **Tab Detection**
   - Listen to `visibilitychange` event
   - Trigger when `document.visibilityState === 'visible'`
   - Only show popup if pending application exists

3. **Three Response Options**
   - **"Yes, Applied":** Create application record with current timestamp
   - **"Applied Earlier":** Create record with backdated timestamp
   - **"No, Just Browsing":** Clear pending state, no record created

### Edge Cases Handled

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Multiple tabs | Track per-job, not global state |
| Quick return (<5s) | Still show popup (user may have copied link) |
| Browser closed | Clear pending on next session start |
| Already applied | Check existing applications, show in popup |
| Double-click Apply | Deduplicate by jobId |

### Alternatives Considered

1. ❌ **Browser Extension:** Too complex, requires installation
2. ❌ **Always Ask:** Annoying for browsing
3. ✅ **Smart Detection:** Only ask when user likely applied
4. ❌ **Manual Entry:** Too much friction

### Why This Works

- **Low Friction:** Only appears when relevant
- **Context Aware:** Shows job details for confirmation
- **Flexible:** Handles multiple scenarios
- **No Tracking:** Respects privacy, no external site monitoring

---

## 📈 Scalability

### Handling 100 Jobs

**Current Performance:**
- Rule-based matching: ~2-3 seconds
- With caching: Subsequent loads instant
- Virtual scrolling ready for 1000+ jobs

**Optimizations:**
- Parallel processing with `Promise.all()`
- Redis caching with 5-minute TTL
- Lazy loading for Best Matches section
- Debounced filter updates

### Handling 10,000 Users

**Architecture Choices:**

1. **Stateless Backend**
   - No in-process state
   - Easy horizontal scaling
   - Deploy behind load balancer

2. **Redis for Session/Data**
   - Upstash: Auto-scales, serverless
   - Persistent storage option
   - Multi-region replication ready

3. **CDN for Frontend**
   - Vercel Edge Network
   - Global distribution
   - Instant cache invalidation

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Per-user API limits
   - Job API caching reduces external calls
   - Graceful degradation to mock data

5. **Database Migration Path**
   - Current: Redis (fast, temporary)
   - Future: PostgreSQL + Redis (persistent + cache)
   - Schema ready for relational data

### Bottlenecks & Solutions

| Bottleneck | Current | Future Solution |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| AI Scoring Speed | 15-20s for 100 jobs | Background job queue (Bull/BullMQ) |
| External API Limits | 500 req/month free | Cache aggressively, upgrade plan |
| Memory Usage | In-memory fallback | Upstash Redis mandatory |
| File Storage | Redis (small resumes) | S3/Cloudinary for production |
